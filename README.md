# Given Requirements:

```
## Ushr Auto Inc. Python Coding Review Example

This example tests your ability to review other's Python code for formatting mistakes and general errors. In this example, we have taken several files from two of our libraries and introduced various typical coding problems that you are tasked to find and correct. Please be a thorough as possible, some errors may be subtle and range from formatting, inconsistent syntax, testing coverage and real bugs.

Unlike normal code reviews, **we would like you to find and correct the coding example.** Please submit the updated code back to Ushr to be evaluated.

### Rules:

1. Please submit one email to [redacted]@ushrauto.com with the subject "Ushr Coding Review" and your updated files zipped and attached.
2. We have included a Conda installer requirements.yaml to get you started. Install [miniconda](<https://conda.io/miniconda.html> "miniconda")/[anaconda](<https://www.anaconda.com/download/> "anaconda") and see instructions in the requirements.yaml to install your environment.
3. We use [numpydoc docstrings](<https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/> "numpydoc docstrings").
4. We adhere to [pep8](<https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/> "pep8"), except we use a max line width of 120 characters and do not use E123 or E124.
5. All unittests are performed through [pytest](<https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/> "pytest"). Open a console to this directory, activate your environment and type "pytest".

##### Happy hunting!
